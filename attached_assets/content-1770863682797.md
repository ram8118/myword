## Frequently Asked Questions

What is Puter.js?

Puter.js is a JavaScript library that brings powerful auth, cloud, and AI services directly to your frontend code. It allows you to use file storage, database, OpenAI models, Claude, and more without any backend or servers.

Puter.js is powered by [Puter](https://github.com/heyputer/puter), the open-source "Internet Computer".

What can I build with Puter.js?

Puter.js enables you to build advanced, cloud-native websites and applications with just frontend code. Some examples include:

- **AI-Powered Tools** like chatbots, content generators, image analysis tools, and text summarizers. Easily integrate with models from OpenAI, Claude, Grok, LLaMA, and DALL-E for various AI tasks.
- **Cloud-Based Productivity Apps** such as note-taking apps, document and spreadsheet editors, task and project management tools, and to-do lists.
- **Web Publishing and Hosting Tools** such as website builders, blogging platforms, and content management systems.
- **Graphical and Media Tools** like image editors, video editors, audio processing tools, and 3D modeling applications.
- **And everything in between!** add scalable, serverless auth, storage, databases, and AI capabilities to any web app.

As we continue to expand Puter.js, more services and capabilities will be added, enabling you to build even more powerful applications.

Where is my API key?

Puter.js does not require an API key. All services are available directly from the client-side, without any configuration or setup. Everything is handled by Puter.js behind the scenes.

How much does Puter.js cost?

**Puter is free for developers!** Puter introduces a groundbreaking approach to infrastructure costs, called the "User Pays" model. Here is how it works:

1. Every user, once authenticated, gets their own allocated resources (storage, database, AI credits, etc.) as part of their account.
2. Apps tap into the user's pre-allocated resources, rather than requiring separate infrastructure.
3. If a user exceeds their resources, they pay Puter directly for the overage.
4. Developers pay $0 for infrastructure, regardless of user count.

This model means developers don't need to provision or pay for separate infrastructure for their apps, regardless of how many users they have.

Do I need to set up a server to use Puter.js?

No, you don't need to set up a server. Puter.js works entirely on the client-side, allowing you to build full-stack applications with just frontend code.

Can I use Puter.js with other frameworks?

Absolutely! Puter.js can be integrated with any JavaScript framework or library, including React, Vue, Angular, and others.

What is the difference between Puter.js and Puter?

Puter.js is a JavaScript library that allows you to access Puter's services directly from your frontend code. Puter is the underlying infrastructure that powers Puter.js, providing cloud, AI, and other services.
